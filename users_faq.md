# Casper Users FAQ
--------------------------------------------------
##  What sites can I stake my CSPR through?
You can currently stake your CSPR through multiple exchanges (see each exchange for more information on staking guidelines with their systems), and on [CSPR.live](https://cspr.live).

## How do I use the Solidity Transpilier?
Once ready, the Solidity Transpilier will modify solidity smart contracts to rust equivalents. Currently, this tool is in development and not ready for public testing.

## Is casper an ERC20 token? Where can I view the smart contract for Casper?
The Casper network is a layer one protocol, and its token, CSPR, is a native token. ERC20 tokens can be deployed on Casper, as well as ERC721-esque NFTs using the featureset from CEP-47, implemented in casper node version 1.3.2 and onwards.
