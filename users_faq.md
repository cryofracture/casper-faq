# Casper Users FAQ
##  What sites can I stake my CSPR through?
You can currently stake your CSPR through multiple exchanges (see each exchange for more information on staking guidelines with their systems), and on [CSPR.live](https://cspr.live).

--------------------------------------------------
## Is casper an ERC20 token? Where can I view the smart contract for Casper?
The Casper network is a layer one protocol, and its token, CSPR, is a native token. ERC20 tokens can be deployed on Casper, as well as ERC721-esque NFTs using the featureset from CEP-47, implemented in casper node version 1.3.2 and onwards.

--------------------------------------------------
## How frequently are staking rewards paid?
Staking rewards are earned by your account on a per era basis. One Era is currently set to 2 hours, and each block is set for 65 seconds. Staking rewards are automatically re-added to your current stake with a given validator.

For the first reward to appear after delegation/staking, it may take upto 2 ERAs (~4 hours).

--------------------------------------------------
## I unstaked some tokens from a validator, why are they not back in my wallet?
There is a 7 era (~14 hour) delay after tokens are unstaked from the network before they are returned to your wallet.
