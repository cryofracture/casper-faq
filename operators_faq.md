# Casper Operators FAQ
--------------------------------------------------
## What operating systems can I run a casper node with?
Casper is currently only tested and packaged for Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04.

## What ports are required for casper-node?
* 35000 (required to be externally visible)

* 7777 RPC endpoint for interaction with casper-client

* 8888 REST endpoint for status and metrics (having this accessible allows your node to be part of network status)

* 9999 SSE endpoint for event stream.

## What are the recommended system specs for a casper node?
* 4 Cores
* 32 GB Ram
* 1 TB disk (Both SSDs and HDDs work, but SSDs perform initial sync much faster.)
* Linux machine running Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04 with a Rust build environment

## How do I check my nodeâ€™s status?
nce your node is running, you can run query your node's status port and look for the .last_added_block_info to confirm a node's synchronization status. The output will look similar to:

```
curl -s http://localhost:8888/status | jq .last_added_block_info
